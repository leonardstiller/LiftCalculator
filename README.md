# Lift Calculator

A Flutter app to use alongside the 5/3/1 routine from Jim Wendler. 

## Introduction

There is currently no free Android App available to keep track of the 5/3/1 routine - the only option follows a subscription model. 
Thus, I decided to build my own. 

This is my first project in Flutter, there are probably a lot of things that could be done more efficient or in a different way - this is my way of learning something new, while giving it a purpose in my day to day life. 

## Features
The features are mostly tied to my own usage / gym habits. Thus at the moment I only support 1 leader and 1 anchor template. (Boring But Big and FSL with Widowmakers)


This app is capable of:
- calculating the correct schedule based on your current week in the corresponding cycle
- automatically increasing the Training Max after a cycle is over
- calculating the number of reps needed to perform a new PR on PR-sets
- tracking all lifts performed in a database
- calculating and visualizing the best lifts performed




### Dev-Notes
-  üêõ Fix navigation 
-  üêõ Add TrainingMax to Lift class instead of separate table
-  ‚ú® Add assistance class + templates - should be tied to current exercise
-  ‚ú® Add assistance to exercise
-  ‚ú® Highlight trained days on date picker
-  ‚ú® Add intro screen on initial startup -- walk trough and TM input screen
