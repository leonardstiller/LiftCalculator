# Lift Calculator

A Flutter app to use alongside the 5/3/1 routine from Jim Wendler. 

## Introduction

There is currently no free Android App available to keep track of the 5/3/1 routine - the only option follows a subscription model. 
Thus, I decided to build my own. 

This is my first project in Flutter, there are probably a lot of things that could be done more efficient or in a different way - this is my way of learning something new, while giving it a purpose in my day to day life. 

## Features
The features are mostly tied to my own usage / gym habits. Thus at the moment I only support 1 leader and 1 anchor template. (Boring but big and FSL with Widowmakers)

- Calculate training plan for every lift/week according to the current cycle
- Stats tracking




TODO:
- [ ] Fix navigation
-   Add assistance class + templates - should be tied to current exercise
-   Add assistance to exercise
-   Show Trainings Max somewhere?

- Handle cycles/finished exercises
// Mark exercise for this week as done, set current to the next one
// If all for this week = done -- next week
// If week 3 - cycle handling
- exercise that is done should not be selectable in home screen / grayed out? 

- Stats screen that shows progress p. lift (needs design and everything)

- Cycle overview screen (needs design and everything)

- Intro screen on initial startup -- walk trough and TM input screen
